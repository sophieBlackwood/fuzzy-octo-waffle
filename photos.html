      <p>I love taking photos. Sometimes it's just for remembering times, dates and events. Other times it is because I am just struck by the beauty of nature or the things around me. They say to see what someone is scared of losing, you just have to look at what they photograph.</p>

      <div class="image-gallery">
        <img src="photos1" alt="books on a bookshelf">
        <p>Taken at work, the sunlight filtering on the books in the early evening always seems to bring warmth and beauty.</p>
        <img src="photos2" alt="sunrise in a parking lot">
        <p>Sometimes I leave seminary just in time to catch beautiful sunrises. These always help the day start right.</p>
        <img src="photos3" alt="people on a field">
        <p>I sprinted around this field faster than a footballer to get this shot, but I love it and how it shows love and support.</p>
        <img src="photos4" alt="sunrise in a parking lot again">
        <p>Another beautiful sunrise, the colors in the sky are at times something that is hard to even show in photos.</p>
        <img src="photos5" alt="cotton candy clouds">
        <p>The sky is so beautiful. The cotton candy clouds this morning were worth a photo to remember the tranquility.</p>
        <img src="photos6" alt="sunset over a straw maze">
        <p>While sitting atop a mountain of straw bales, I witnessed the beautiful sunset with friends.</p>
        <img src="photos7" alt="girl smiling">
        <p>When someone sticks a camera in your face, you're not quite sure what to do. Smile? Frown? Ignore it? That's why you just take the photos.</p>
        <img src="photos8" alt="rainbows">
        <p>The rainbow outside work brought a smile to our faces as it countered the dreary day and stormy skies of the day.</p>
        <img src="photos9" alt="clouds highlighting a temple spire">
        <p>The temple will never not look beautiful to me. I could touch it and even still I would swear to you that it is to gorgeous to touch. It is majestic.</p>
        <img src="photos10" alt="grave of a girl">
        <p>Lyndee was a fantastic girl, taken too young. Visiting her grave and keeping it decorated as I live the life she never got is bittersweet to me.</p>
        <img src="photos11" alt="girl taking a selfie">
        <p>I don't like my hair down but the lighting of the computer screen illuminated my face in a good way which turned out well. I am not photogenic.</p>
        <img src="photos12" alt="Temple spire">
        <p>The beautiful peace of the temple and the cutting difference of it and the sky is unique. Photographing the temple never gets old.</p>
        <img src="photos13" alt="docks with choppy waters">
        <p>The wind, while annoying, keeps the water fluid and moving. The sound of the waves is really peaceful when I have a tulmultous mind and can't stop thinking.</p>
        <img src="photos14" alt="white flower">
        <p>Flowers are so pretty, so fragile but every one is unique. I think people should recieve flowers more often, they brighten a room and are so diverse.</p>
        <img src="photos15" alt="trees with clouds">
        <p>The clouds tell stories of their own, creating visual interest and diversity in this picture. Laying in the hammock outside, I knew I had to take a picture.</p>
        <img src="photos16" alt="the temple from afar">
        <p>Even from afar the temple just seems to stand out. Even with the fences that used to keep us far away, the special presence of a building like this has never decreased.</p>
        <img src="photos17" alt="sun with varied clouds">
        <p>Isn't it fascinating how sun and clouds can create so many different pictures? Why do we look down when we could be looking up. At all this beauty. Even the clairty of a simple blue sky holds majesty.</p>
        <img src="photos18" alt="Temple at night">
        <p>The lights of the temple illuminate the beautiful stained glass art. I have yet to decide if I like going during the day or at night more. Both are beautiful. </p>
        <img src="photos19" alt="red sunset">
        <p>The sky set on fire allows for breathtaking views. It is simply unique and divine in ways that a normal blue sky cannot.</p>
